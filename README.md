## ü§ñ Setting Up Ollama

YFin uses Ollama for enhanced sentiment analysis and news search capabilities. This step is optional but recommended for accessing all features.

### Installing Ollama

1. Visit [Ollama's official website](https://ollama.ai/) and download the installer for your operating system.

2. Follow the installation instructions for your platform:
   - **macOS**: Run the downloaded .dmg file and follow the installer prompts
   - **Windows**: Run the installer .exe file
   - **Linux**: Follow the command-line instructions from the Ollama website

### Configuring Ollama for YFin

1. Pull the recommended model (llama3.1) used by YFin:
   ```
   ollama pull llama3.1
   ```

2. List available models to verify installation:
   ```
   ollama list
   ```
   You should see "llama3.1" in the list of available models.

3. The YFin application will automatically use Ollama if it's running. To manually start the Ollama service:
   ```
   # On macOS/Linux, you can start Ollama with:
   ollama serve
   
   # Keep this terminal window open while using YFin
   ```

4. To test that Ollama is working correctly:
   ```
   ollama run llama3.1
   ```
   Type a test prompt and press Ctrl+C to exit when finished.

When running YFin, the application will automatically attempt to use Ollama for enhanced sentiment analysis if it's available.

## üöÄ Running the Application

Option 1: Using the run script (recommended):
```
python run.py
```

Option 2: Directly with Streamlit:
```
streamlit run src/app.py
```

The application will be available at http://localhost:8501 in your web browser.

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter dependency issues during installation:
- For Python 3.13 users: Some packages may require the latest versions. Try removing version constraints from requirements.txt.
